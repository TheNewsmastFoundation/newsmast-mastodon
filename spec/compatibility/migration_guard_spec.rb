# a column/table the gem adds may already exist in the host Mastodon schema
# (either because upstream added it natively, or a prior gem version did).

# Every migration must therefore be idempotent. We enforce this statically by
# asserting that each `add_column` / `add_index` / `create_table` /
# `add_reference` is paired with an existence guard, so a single unguarded
# migration fails CI before it can break a host `db:migrate`.
